            <div class="lg-text mx-auto">
                <p>Conceived at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, "We Are Watching" is a response to the rise in anti-Asian discrimination 
                    and assualt that was seen in the U.S. and around the world.</p>
            </div>

            <img class="lg-img mb-3" src="we-are-watching/mockup2.png" alt="mockup 2">

            <div class="lg-text mx-auto">
                <p>The murals, of which there would be no duplicates, would be painted anonymously and unannounced in the U.S. cities with the highest reported discriminatory incidents. The eyes have irises inspired by the flags of various eastern Asian countries, as the people with these ethnic backgrounds might “look Chinese” and consequently be targeted for their racial phenotype. The goat is a nod to ther term "scapegoat" and people’s tendency to place blame during times of crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each image then has corresponding text, as I wanted viewers to be left with the impression that they are being directly addressed, rather than let them be mere observers.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sm-img-div mx-auto mb-3">
                <img class="md-img float-left d-block" src="we-are-watching/collage.png" alt="eye variations">
                <img class="md-img float-right d-block" src="we-are-watching/goat-with-text.png" alt="scapegoat">
            </div>
           
            <div class="lg-text mx-auto">
                <p>I intended for the murals’ anonymous, vandalistic nature to amplify their impact. Would viewers feel a sense of solidarity with the unknown painter? Maybe they would feel comforted that someone was speaking up for them outside the diplomatic confines of their city’s law enforcement. Would they be angry at the implications behind the mural and the fact that they do not know who to hold responsible? Perhaps they would feel as though they are being watched, similar to how many Asians likely feel now. Ideally, the lack of authorship would allow these murals to become an entity of their own, allowing the focus to remain on them and the reactions they inspire, rather than their creator.
