            <div class="lg-text mx-auto">
                <p>The campaign "Campus Reimagined" is the result of an assignment that only had two constraints: it had to involve a local community, and it had to relate to wellness/the outdoors. After some preliminary interviews, I settled on the following problem statement: Northeastern students
                    need a way to voice their opinions and ideate about the spaces on campus so that they can experience student-driven changes that make campus a better place for their wants and needs.

            <p class="section-header mx-auto lg-text">Research Methods</p>
            <div class="lg-text mx-auto">
                In order to design a solution, I used the following four research methods, listed roughly in order of use throughout the project.

                I first developed a better awareness for the current state of Northeastern's campus and its student behaviors through ethnographical observation. I took note of both micro-level behaviors, such as how students used the chairs placed on the green space, as well as macro-level behaviors, such as where the students clustered and how they moved around various spaces.

                After familiarizing myself more with Northeastern's campus, I began researching pre-existing solutions that revolved around using outdoor spaces. The two major uses of the outdoor spaces on campus were recreation and studying, thus, short of razing the current campus and redesigning the quads and pathways to better accomodate recreational activities, I focused on solutions that improved the experience of working outside. 
                 <br><br>
                I also started considering the issue that students' needs were always changing; for example, when COVID-19 hit, safe, outdoor spaces to work became a necessity for students and their mental health. Thus, rather than trying to design for current pain points, I began exploring systems that would promote consistent improvements to campus, such as the "Envision Cambridge" campaign.

                <!-- insert key text/sample questions here -->
                sent out survey to cover as wide of a variety of northeastern students as possible, targeting different interests, grades, where they lived, etc. to gauge what kinds of answers would be given

                <p>The campaign would consist of booths strategically placed around campus (outside of residential buildings, rather than in the middle of campus where people were more likely to be walking between classes) to encourage engagement. At each booth would be moderators&mdash; who would be handing out the flyers and answering questions&mdash;, in addition to free stamps, envelopes, stickers, and pins.</p>

                To try and measure the success of the intervention, we would collect the email addresses and residencies of students who took the booth's resources, as well as whether they were registering to vote and/or requesting an absentee ballot. When a local or state election took place for them, we would email a follow-up survey asking if they voted.
