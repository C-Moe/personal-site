            <div className="paragraphSpacer" />
            Working with the district and subject matter experts (SMEs), I along

            with parents who were actively going through the change to better
            understand the challenges around participating in community
            engagement initiatives for attendance boundary planning. We
            synthesized recurring themes and consolidated ideas by creating an
            affinity diagram from our notes and transcripts, finding three major
            patterns.

            <h4>usability challenges</h4>
            Parents expressed how cumbersome the existing community engagement
            process was. It took a significant amount of time to find
            information about the redistricting, and it was difficult to use the
            supplied map interface to understand possible boundary scenarios.
            <div className="paragraphSpacer" />
            Those who were leaders in their communities shared that people often
            were not aware of what information was available, what was
            happening, etc.
            <div className="subsectionSpacer" />
            <h4>tension between individual and collective</h4>
            Some interviewees mainly wanted to know how boundary changes would
            impact their own families, while others wanted to look at the bigger
            picture. Interviewees also brought up not trusting other parents, or
            on the other end, wanting to hear from other parents to get more
            ideas and viewpoints.
            <div className="subsectionSpacer" />
            <h4>distrust between community and the district</h4>
            Parents also felt that feedback was being ignored by the school
            district, which led some to not fill out the surveys at all.
            <div className="paragraphSpacer" />
            They also did not understand the rationale behind the decisions that
            were being made. A couple of parents suggested framing the boundary
            changes in terms of four priorities that the school board agreed
            upon in the past.

              <div className="paragraphSpacer" />
              We then brainstormed potential platforms, using our similar ideas
              as a starting point. Some possibilities included a chat app to
              address questions and establish a feedback loop through "read
              receipts," and a "choose your own adventure" app for a more
              engaging experience that could also encourage empathy.
              <div className="paragraphSpacer" />
              We initially settled on a website that would revolve around a
              timeline, with elements that highlighted feedback events, as well
              as documented the process. We saw positive reactions when we
              talked with the school and SMEs, but felt that the idea was not
              pushing what was possible or already known.

                We assessed BoundarEase by conducting{" "}
                <span className="highlight">12 semi-structured</span>{" "}
                interviews, asking participants to think aloud as they
                interacted with a desktop version of the platform and answered
                periodic questions. A teammate and I then synthesized the data
                with thematic coding, segmenting the interviews into units and
                assigning each unit a code for analysis.

                    stated BoundarEase was clearer in how new boundaries would
                    affect their families and others compared to the current
                    process

                    believed BoundarEase helped them understand how others might
                    be affected and/or what they care about
                  </div>
                  <div className="subsectionSpacer" />
                  We also found that participants really appreciated the
                  scaffolded qualitative feedback experience, brevity and
                  relevance of included information, and interactivity of the
                  platform (e.g. personalized statistics and ability to toggle
                  between different scenarios).
                  <div className="paragraphSpacer" />
                  Per our design questions, we found
                  <ol id="userstudy_dq_results">
                    <li>
                      Placing families in the context of the community prompted
                      participants to think about impacts on others. However,
                      this didn't resolve cognitive dissonance that the
                      scenarios they saw as beneficial to them were the same
                      scenarios that were detrimental to others.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The perspective-getting feature was met with mixed
                      reactions; some parents thought it would add healthy
                      friction, while others wanted a more diverse sample of
                      perspectives or skipped it entirely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Overall, interviewees felt that framing a scenario through
                      the four pillars was extremely helpful in grounding the
                      conversation; they could discuss the potential districting
                      with the board and other parents more "rationally" than
                      emotionally.

                  Our next steps would be to iterate based on the feedback we
                  received to deploy at a larger scale.
