                <p>"Remembering Us," loosely inspired by a wishing tree tradition in China, is a conceptualized, temporary installation meant to provide the resources and environment for introspection and connection. Intended to be built at Boston, Massachusetts’ Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park, the installation would be at the center of a major tourist attraction in the Boston area, as well as juxtaposed with the nearby, fast-paced financial district. A volunteer would encourage passersby to sit and write their favorite memory on a piece of plantable paper cut in the shape of a tag, follwing <a href="remembering-us/instructions-for-moderator.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>these</b></a> instructions. Participants could then tie their tag to the nearby tree branches or arches in the park with environmentally-friendly twine. </p>

                <p>Drawing architectural inspiration from Ludwig Mies van der Rohe’s Farnsworth House, the structure for Remembering Us is designed to be light and minimalistic, with the intent of creating a welcoming but reflective atmosphere, as well as allowing the focus of the installation to be the tags on which participants write. The pillows and legless tables are inspired by Japanese tea houses, which contain low furniture to symbolize that all their visitors are considered equal upon entering the house, regardless of concepts like title, class, or status. This is meant to drive home the intent of the installation: provide a safe space where we can view one another without the labels placed on us.</p>

            <div class="lg-text mx-auto">
                <p>Ideally, anyone who visits the park, from local Bostonians to overseas tourists, would feel comfortable writing down their favorite – and presumably happiest – memory. My hope is that, regardless of age, nationality, class, or spoken language, we all can empathize and connect with each others’ pockets of happiness; though our differences appear to separate us, I think our emotions can be universally understood.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lg-text mx-auto">
                <p>This installation is conceived in a time where our differences and identities are a cause of hostility and fear. People are belittled for their gender, constrained by their socioeconomic status, and alienated because of their race. In a time of pandemic scares, political wars, and international hostility, I would like to provide a small place where we can display our humanity and be reminded of the goodness in ourselves and others.</p>
